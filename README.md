# RUST

## 1. Cargo

###1.1. Rust's build system and package manager

- Building our code,

- downloading dependencies,

- building those dependencies.

###1.2. Build and run a cargo project 

Either one of the following is perfectly ok

- `cargo build` then `./target/debug/{package_name}`

- `cargo run`: build and execute in one command
